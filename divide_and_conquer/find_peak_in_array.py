PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
Given an array A of N integers. The task is to find a peak element in it in O( log N ) .
An array element is peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.
Note: There may be multiple peak element possible, in that case you may return any valid index (0 based indexing).

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array.

Output:
For each test case output will be 1 if the index returned by the function is an index with peak element.

User Task:
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the provided function peakElement() and return the valid index.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[] <= 106

Example:
Input:
2
3
1 2 3
2
3 4
Output:
1
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: In the given array, 3 is the peak element as it is greater than its neighbour.
Testcase 2: 4 is the peak element as it is greater than its neighbour elements.

LOGIC
-----
Create two variables, l and r, initilize l = 0 and r = n-1
Iterate the steps below till l <= r, lowerbound is less than the upperbound
Check if the mid value or index mid = (l+r)/2, is the peak element or not, if yes then print the element and terminate.
Else if the element on the left side of the middle element is greater then check for peak element on the left side, i.e. update r = mid â€“ 1
Else if the element on the right side of the middle element is greater then check for peak element on the right side, i.e. update l = mid + 1
