PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
Delete xth node from a singly linked list. Your task is to complete the method deleteNode() which takes two arguments: the address of the head of the linked list and an integer x. The function returns the head of the modified linked list.

Input:
The first line of input contains an element T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains three lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements of the linked list. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the linked list. The third line of each test case contains an integer x.

Output:
The output for each test case will be the space separated value of the returned linked list.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteNode() which should delete the node at required position.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 300
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= x <= N

Example:
Input:
2
3
1 3 4
3
4
1 5 2 9
2

Output:
1 3
1 2 9

Explanation:
Testcase 1: After deleting the node at 3rd position (1-base indexing), the linked list is as 1-> 3.
Testcase 2: After deleting the node at 2nd position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as 1-> 2-> 9.
