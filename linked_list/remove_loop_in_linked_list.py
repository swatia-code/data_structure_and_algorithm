PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
You are given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove the loop from the linked list, if present.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. T testcases follow. For each testcase, first line of input contains length N of the linked list and next line contains N data of the linked list. The third line contains the position of the node(from head) to which the last node will get connected. If it is 0 then there is no loop.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, 1 will be printed if loop is removed and the list still has all N nodes connected to it, else 0 will be printed.

User Task:
Your task is to complete the function removeLoop(). The only argument of the function is head pointer of the linked list. Do not print anything. Simply remove the loop in the list (if present) without disconnecting any nodes from the list.

Expected time complexity : O(n)

Expected auxiliary space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 102
1 <= N <= 104

Example:
Input:
2
3
1 3 4
2
4
1 8 3 4
0
Output:
1
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: In the first test case N = 3.The linked list with nodes N = 3 is given. Here, x = 2 which means last node is connected with xth node of linked list. Therefore, there exists a loop. 
Testcase 2: N = 4 and x = 0, which means lastNode->next = NULL, thus the Linked list does not contains any loop.

LOGIC
-----
After detecting the loop, if we start slow pointer from head and move both slow and fast pointers at same speed until fast don't meet, they would meet at the beginning of the loop.

How does this work? Let slow and fast meet at some point after Floyd's Cycle finding algorithm. Below diagram shows the situation when cycle is found.
Distance traveled by fast pointer = 2 * (Distance traveled 
                                         by slow pointer)

(m + n*x + k) = 2*(m + n*y + k)

Note that before meeting the point shown above, fast
was moving at twice speed.

x -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by 
       fast pointer before they meet first time

y -->  Number of complete cyclic rounds made by 
       slow pointer before they meet first time
From above equation, we can conclude below
    m + k = (x-2y)*n

Which means m+k is a multiple of n. 
Thus we can write, m + k = i*n or m = i*n - k.
Hence, distance moved by slow pointer: m, is equal to distance moved by fast pointer:
i*n - k or (i-1)*n + n - k (cover the loop completely i-1 times and start from n-k).

So if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from head node of linked list and other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point. When slow pointer reaches beginning of loop (has made m steps), fast pointer would have made also moved m steps as they are now moving same pace. Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k, they would meet at the beginning. Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.
